# vobla-win
vobla-win is a desktop client for [vobla](https://github.com/nuqlear/vobla).  
:warning: :warning: it's code is awful :warning: :warning: , but it has implementation of invisible top-level window in C# WPF, which is kinda tricky to do and therefore can be useful for someone who is looking for such thing.

The application itself has two functions:
- Press Ctrl-Shift-3 => screenshot of entire screen is uploaded
- Press Ctrl-Shift-4 => cursor transforms to crosshair and app is waiting for selection of screen area to upload.
